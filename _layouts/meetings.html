<h2>Upcoming Meetings</h2>
<p>
<div class="post">
  Our technical meetings are held the last Thursday of every month (Nov/Dec subject to change), from 7pm to 9pm, in the back room at Mister Tramps. To access this room enter through the front of tramps and head straight towards the back. Either the huge sliding door will be open (you arrived early) or it will be closed (do not open it). To the left of the huge sliding door is a small door leading to the bathrooms. Through the door and down the hall on your right is the door to the meeting room. This is the only door you should use. DO NOT use the service entrance to the left of the bar. See the <a href="http://mistertramps.com/">Mister Tramps</a> site for details on the venue. Here’s a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=mister+tramps&aq=&sll=30.395835,-97.698202&sspn=0.012678,0.018432&ie=UTF8&hq=mister+tramps&hnear=&ll=30.3616,-97.717338&spn=0.012683,0.018432&z=16&iwloc=A">map</a> — the bistro is on the northbound side of 183-N, between Lamar and Burnet.

Food and drinks will still be permissible at the meeting, provided you purchase said food and drink from Mister Tramps.
